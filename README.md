# CSharpClientMessenger
This uses PHP and C# to send simple requests back and forth!

# PHP Install

This requires a server...

I recommend Centos 6

Install apache and drag the php file in /var/www/html

If you are using Centos, Enter this command:

chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html

# C# Setup

Configure the code in the messenger to get it set up and connected to your server.

This part is pretty self explanatory.


Also, Feel free to edit this to your liking, I made this to help others out, You don't have to credit me for this.

Another thing, I tried to clean up the program the best I could.

Enjoy!
